                            Hack & Tackle, is an inter and intra-college hackathon. The first edition, conducted from 31st Jan - 1st Feb 2019, was lauded for its efficient logistics despite the grand participation from across the state. Keeping up with its intention to provide an unhindered platform for students to develop realistic and intelligent solutions to problems prevalent in the society, the second edition of this magnificent event will be held on 20 Feb 2020. Striving for the 2020 vision by stimulating the spark in the youth has been the principle motive behind this event. We hope this yearâ€™s edition beholds students surpassing expectations and coming out in flying colours.
